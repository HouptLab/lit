# A Simple Example

This is a basic example of how literate programming works. You can write whatever you want here using any Markdown or HTML. When you're ready to start coding, just open up a code block by typing three backticks:

```ruby
puts 'hello world!'
```

When you run the compiler script as described in the [README.md](instructions), it will strip away all this explanatory material and create a new file consisting of [only the code sections](hello-world.rb).

So what do you think?

```ruby
puts 'wow, that is really cool!'
```
